In this task, text mining and sentiment analysis were applied to a dataset comprising diverse reviews of products and services from three different online brands. The 
analysis aims to score and classify the reviews, even though already labelled as positives and negatives, as either negative, positive, or neutral, using natural language 
processing while discarding the pre-existing labels. Based on the classified reviews, the task takes further attempts to build a classification model that can take instant 
custom reviews as input and analyse the sentiments.
